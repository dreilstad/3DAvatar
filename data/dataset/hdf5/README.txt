README.txt is included in folder to make it appear in repository, and does not cause error when running code.

In this folder, ~/data/dataset/hdf5/, the point cloud dataset will be saved. When recording a lot of frames,
the resulting hdf5 file will be large. Therefore, hdf5 files are ignored when making commits.
